# Vector 2: Statistical A/B Testing & Early Stopping

**Research Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Purpose**: Replace ARBITRARY thresholds in prompt evolution system with statistically rigorous methods

## Summary

This research provides statistical rigor for tinyArms prompt evolution A/B testing. Key findings: (1) Sample size calculation requires power analysis balancing Type I/II error rates, (2) Sequential testing enables early stopping with 25-50% sample reduction while controlling false positive rates at 5%, (3) Thompson Sampling outperforms fixed allocation for small sample sizes (10-50 votes) through dynamic traffic allocation and Bayesian updating. **Recommendation**: Use Sequential Testing with Thompson Sampling for tinyArms to minimize votes required while maintaining statistical validity.

## Sample Size Calculation

### Formula for Two Proportions

```
n = (Z_Œ±/2 + Z_Œ≤)¬≤ √ó [p1(1-p1) + p2(1-p2)] / (p1 - p2)¬≤

WHERE:
- n = sample size needed PER VARIANT
- Z_Œ±/2 = critical value for significance level (e.g., 1.96 for Œ±=0.05, two-tailed)
- Z_Œ≤ = critical value for power (e.g., 0.84 for power=0.80)
- p1 = baseline accuracy (e.g., 0.78)
- p2 = expected accuracy after improvement (e.g., 0.85)
- (p1 - p2) = effect size (minimum detectable effect)
```

### For tinyArms (Example Calculation)

**Scenario**:
- Baseline accuracy: `p1 = 0.78` (78%)
- Target accuracy: `p2 = 0.85` (85%)
- Effect size: `Œ¥ = 0.07` (7% lift)
- Significance level: `Œ± = 0.05` (95% confidence, two-tailed)
- Power: `1 - Œ≤ = 0.80` (80% probability of detecting real effect)

**Calculation**:
```
Z_Œ±/2 = 1.96  (for 95% confidence, two-tailed)
Z_Œ≤ = 0.84    (for 80% power)

n = (1.96 + 0.84)¬≤ √ó [0.78(0.22) + 0.85(0.15)] / (0.07)¬≤
n = (2.80)¬≤ √ó [0.1716 + 0.1275] / 0.0049
n = 7.84 √ó 0.2991 / 0.0049
n ‚âà 478 votes per variant

For 3 variants: 478 √ó 3 = 1,434 total votes
```

**Reality Check**: 478 votes per variant is IMPRACTICAL for tinyArms (single-user system). This justifies SEQUENTIAL TESTING + SMALL SAMPLE BAYESIAN methods below.

## Early Stopping Criteria

### Problem: Fixed Sample Size Wastes Time

**Traditional A/B testing**: Decide sample size upfront (e.g., 478 votes), wait until collected, THEN analyze. If winner is obvious at vote 100, you still wait for 478.

**Solution**: Sequential testing - check results continuously, stop when confident.

### Sequential Testing Framework

**Method 1: Simple Sequential A/B Test (Evan Miller)**

**Formula**:
```
STOP and declare winner when:
  |T - C| ‚â• 2‚àöN

WHERE:
- T = treatment successes (votes for new variant)
- C = control successes (votes for baseline)
- N = planned sample size (from power analysis)
- 2 = approximation of Z_Œ±/2 for Œ±=0.05 (exact: 1.96)

For two-sided test (detect worse OR better):
  |T - C| ‚â• 2.25‚àöN
```

**Example**:
```
Planned N = 478 per variant (from above)
‚àö478 = 21.86
Boundary = 2 √ó 21.86 ‚âà 44 votes difference

Check after every 10 votes:
- At vote 50: Variant A = 42 votes, Variant B = 8 votes ‚Üí |42-8| = 34 < 44 ‚Üí CONTINUE
- At vote 100: Variant A = 78 votes, Variant B = 22 votes ‚Üí |78-22| = 56 > 44 ‚Üí STOP, declare A winner
```

**Source**: Evan Miller - "Simple Sequential A/B Testing"
**URL**: https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html

**Advantages**:
- Stops 25-50% earlier for "blockbuster" effects (large true difference)
- False positive rate controlled at Œ± (5%) even with continuous monitoring
- No "peeking penalty" (traditional tests inflate Type I error when checked early)

**Disadvantages**:
- Slightly longer under null hypothesis (no real difference)
- Requires planned sample size N upfront (but you stop early if winner emerges)

---

### Method 2: Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)

**How SPRT Works**:
```
At each observation, calculate likelihood ratio (LR):
  LR = P(data | H1) / P(data | H0)

WHERE:
- H0 = null hypothesis (no difference between variants)
- H1 = alternative hypothesis (variant A is better by Œ¥)

Decision boundaries:
- If LR ‚â• A ‚Üí STOP, declare H1 (variant A wins)
- If LR ‚â§ B ‚Üí STOP, declare H0 (no significant difference)
- If B < LR < A ‚Üí CONTINUE testing

Boundaries (Wald's SPRT):
  A = (1 - Œ≤) / Œ±
  B = Œ≤ / (1 - Œ±)

For Œ±=0.05, Œ≤=0.20:
  A = 0.80 / 0.05 = 16
  B = 0.20 / 0.95 ‚âà 0.21
```

**Source**: Wald (1945), Wikipedia "Sequential probability ratio test"

**Advantages**:
- Optimal sequential test (Wald-Wolfowitz theorem: minimizes expected sample size)
- No "peeking" problem (designed for continuous monitoring)
- Flexible stopping (no fixed N required)

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex to implement (likelihood ratio calculation)
- Requires specifying effect size Œ¥ in advance

**Practical Tools**:
- Statsig SPRT: https://docs.statsig.com/experiments-plus/sprt/
- R package `SPRT`: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SPRT/

---

### Method 3: Optimizely's Stats Engine (Always Valid Inference)

**Approach**: Uses mSPRT (modified SPRT) with mixture likelihoods to handle uncertainty about effect size.

**Key Innovation**: No need to specify Œ¥ upfront - averages over possible effect sizes.

**Formula** (simplified):
```
Calculate "always valid p-value" at time t:
  p_t = min(1, mixture of likelihood ratios)

STOP when p_t < Œ± (e.g., 0.05)
```

**Source**: Johari et al. (2015) "Always Valid Inference: Continuous Monitoring of A/B Tests"
**URL**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04922

**Advantages**:
- No need to pre-specify effect size
- False positive rate controlled at Œ± regardless of when you check
- Used in production by Optimizely, VWO

**Disadvantages**:
- More conservative than fixed-sample tests (requires slightly more data)
- Complex implementation (mixture likelihood calculation)

---

### Practical Configuration for tinyArms

**Recommended Approach**: Simple Sequential Test (Evan Miller) + Bayesian confidence intervals

**Decision Rules**:
```yaml
# Check after every N votes
check_interval: 5

# Stop early if ANY condition met:
early_stop_conditions:
  1. Sequential boundary crossed:
     |winner_votes - runner_up_votes| ‚â• 2.25‚àöN_planned

  2. Bayesian confidence high:
     P(variant_A > variant_B | data) > 0.95

  3. Maximum votes reached:
     total_votes ‚â• max_votes (e.g., 50)

  4. Maximum time elapsed:
     days_elapsed ‚â• max_days (e.g., 7)

# If no winner by max_votes/max_days ‚Üí declare "no significant difference"
```

**Why 2.25‚àöN (not 2‚àöN)?**
- Two-sided test (variant could be worse OR better)
- More conservative (reduces false positives)

**Bayesian Confidence Calculation**:
```python
# For each variant, maintain Beta distribution
# Prior: Beta(1, 1) - uniform
# Update: Beta(Œ± + successes, Œ≤ + failures)

# Monte Carlo sampling to estimate P(A > B)
samples_A = beta.rvs(Œ±_A, Œ≤_A, size=10000)
samples_B = beta.rvs(Œ±_B, Œ≤_B, size=10000)
prob_A_wins = np.mean(samples_A > samples_B)

# Stop if prob_A_wins > 0.95 (95% confidence)
```

---

## Multi-Armed Bandits

### Problem: Fixed Allocation Wastes Traffic on Losers

**Traditional A/B testing**: Allocate 33% traffic to each variant (A, B, C) until test ends. If B is clearly losing by vote 20, you still send 33% traffic to B for remaining 30 votes.

**Solution**: Multi-armed bandits - allocate MORE traffic to winners dynamically.

### Thompson Sampling (RECOMMENDED for tinyArms)

**Algorithm**:
```
FOR each variant i:
  Initialize: successes_i = 0, failures_i = 0

AT EACH decision point (new task):
  FOR each variant i:
    Sample Œ∏_i ~ Beta(successes_i + 1, failures_i + 1)

  SELECT variant with highest Œ∏_i

  OBSERVE reward (user votes üëç or üëé)

  IF reward = 1 (üëç):
    successes_i += 1
  ELSE:
    failures_i += 1
```

**Source**: Russo et al. (2018) "A Tutorial on Thompson Sampling", Stanford
**URL**: https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/pubs/TS_Tutorial.pdf

**Why Beta Distribution?**
- **Conjugate prior** for Bernoulli likelihood (binary votes: üëç/üëé)
- **Bayesian updating** is simple algebra: `Beta(Œ±, Œ≤) + success ‚Üí Beta(Œ±+1, Œ≤)`
- **Closed-form posterior** (no numerical integration needed)

**Intuition**:
- Each variant has a "belief distribution" over its true win rate
- Sample from each distribution ‚Üí variant with highest sample gets shown
- Early on (few votes): distributions overlap ‚Üí exploration happens naturally
- Later (many votes): winner's distribution shifts right ‚Üí exploitation dominates

**Example**:
```
Vote 1: Variant A = Beta(1,1), B = Beta(1,1), C = Beta(1,1)
  Sample: A=0.52, B=0.48, C=0.61 ‚Üí Show C
  User votes üëç ‚Üí C = Beta(2,1)

Vote 2: Variant A = Beta(1,1), B = Beta(1,1), C = Beta(2,1)
  Sample: A=0.43, B=0.39, C=0.73 ‚Üí Show C (higher prior)
  User votes üëé ‚Üí C = Beta(2,2)

Vote 10: A = Beta(1,3), B = Beta(5,1), C = Beta(2,4)
  Mean win rates: A=0.25, B=0.83, C=0.40
  ‚Üí B shown ~60% of time (dynamic allocation)
```

---

### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) - Alternative

**Algorithm**:
```
SELECT variant i with highest:
  UCB_i = mean_i + ‚àö(2 ln(t) / n_i)

WHERE:
- mean_i = empirical win rate for variant i
- t = total number of votes so far
- n_i = number of times variant i was shown
```

**Source**: Auer et al. (2002) "Finite-time Analysis of the Multiarmed Bandit Problem"

**Intuition**:
- **Exploitation term**: `mean_i` (choose what worked best)
- **Exploration term**: `‚àö(2 ln(t) / n_i)` (boost variants shown less often)
- As n_i increases ‚Üí exploration term shrinks ‚Üí focus on winner

---

### Thompson Sampling vs UCB Comparison

| Dimension | Thompson Sampling | UCB |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| **Type** | Probabilistic (Bayesian) | Deterministic (Frequentist) |
| **Allocation** | Stochastic (sample from distribution) | Deterministic (pick highest UCB) |
| **Prior Knowledge** | Can incorporate (adjust Œ±, Œ≤) | Assumes no prior |
| **Small Samples** | Excellent (10-50 votes) | Good (requires tuning) |
| **Delayed Feedback** | Handles well (batch updates) | Requires immediate feedback |
| **Implementation** | Simple (Beta sampling) | Simple (arithmetic) |
| **Parameters** | None (self-tuning) | Requires tuning `c` in `c‚àö(2 ln(t)/n)` |
| **Performance** | Empirically better for most problems | Theoretical guarantees (regret bounds) |

**Source**: Comparison studies (ResearchGate 350357541, Towards Data Science)

**Recommendation for tinyArms**: **Thompson Sampling**
- **Why**: No parameter tuning, handles small samples (10-50 votes), Bayesian updating matches prompt evolution philosophy (learn from mistakes)
- **When to use UCB**: If you need deterministic behavior (reproducible tests)

## Statistical Significance

### Metrics to Track

#### 1. Confidence Interval

**Formula** (for proportion):
```
CI = pÃÇ ¬± Z_Œ±/2 √ó ‚àö(pÃÇ(1-pÃÇ) / n)

WHERE:
- pÃÇ = sample proportion (votes_for / total_votes)
- n = sample size
- Z_Œ±/2 = 1.96 for 95% confidence
```

**Example**:
```
Variant A: 18 üëç out of 25 votes ‚Üí pÃÇ = 0.72
CI = 0.72 ¬± 1.96 √ó ‚àö(0.72 √ó 0.28 / 25)
CI = 0.72 ¬± 0.18
CI = [0.54, 0.90]

Interpretation: "We're 95% confident true win rate is 54-90%"
```

**Bayesian Credible Interval** (for Thompson Sampling):
```python
# Variant A: Beta(successes=18, failures=7)
credible_interval = beta.ppf([0.025, 0.975], 18+1, 7+1)
# Returns: [0.557, 0.869] - similar to frequentist CI
```

**Interpretation**: "Given the data, there's 95% probability true win rate is 56-87%"

---

#### 2. P-value

**Definition**: Probability of observing data this extreme (or more) if null hypothesis (no difference) is true.

**Formula** (two-proportion z-test):
```
z = (pÃÇ1 - pÃÇ2) / ‚àö(pÃÇ(1-pÃÇ) √ó (1/n1 + 1/n2))

WHERE:
- pÃÇ = pooled proportion = (x1 + x2) / (n1 + n2)
- pÃÇ1, pÃÇ2 = sample proportions for variants
- n1, n2 = sample sizes

p-value = 2 √ó P(Z > |z|)  (two-tailed)
```

**Example**:
```
Variant A: 18/25 = 0.72
Variant B: 10/25 = 0.40
Pooled: (18+10)/(25+25) = 0.56

z = (0.72 - 0.40) / ‚àö(0.56 √ó 0.44 √ó (1/25 + 1/25))
z = 0.32 / 0.140 = 2.29

p-value = 2 √ó P(Z > 2.29) = 2 √ó 0.011 = 0.022
```

**Interpretation**: "If variants are truly equal, there's 2.2% chance we'd see this large a difference. Since p < 0.05, REJECT null ‚Üí A is significantly better."

---

#### 3. Effect Size (Cohen's d)

**Formula**:
```
Cohen's d = (Œº1 - Œº2) / œÉ_pooled

WHERE:
- Œº1, Œº2 = sample means
- œÉ_pooled = ‚àö((œÉ1¬≤ + œÉ2¬≤) / 2)
```

**For proportions** (conversion rate difference):
```
Effect size = |p1 - p2|

Cohen's benchmarks:
- Small: d = 0.2 (2% difference)
- Medium: d = 0.5 (5% difference)
- Large: d = 0.8 (8% difference)
```

**Example**:
```
Variant A: 0.72 win rate
Variant B: 0.40 win rate
Effect size = |0.72 - 0.40| = 0.32 (LARGE effect)
```

**Source**: Cohen (1988) "Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences"

**Why It Matters**:
- **Statistical significance** (p-value) tells you IF difference exists
- **Practical significance** (effect size) tells you HOW BIG the difference is
- Large sample ‚Üí tiny differences become "significant" but meaningless
- Small sample ‚Üí large differences may not reach "significance" but are important

---

#### 4. Statistical Power

**Definition**: Probability of detecting a true effect (1 - Œ≤)

**Standard**: 0.80 (80% power) = 20% chance of Type II error (missing real improvement)

**Why 80%?**
- Convention from Cohen (1988)
- Balance between sample size cost and detection ability
- Higher power (0.90) ‚Üí requires 1.5-2√ó more samples

**Relationship to Sample Size**:
```
Keeping Œ± and power constant:
- Larger effect size ‚Üí SMALLER sample needed
- Smaller effect size ‚Üí LARGER sample needed

Example (Œ±=0.05, power=0.80):
- Detect 10% lift: n ‚âà 200 per variant
- Detect 5% lift: n ‚âà 800 per variant
- Detect 2% lift: n ‚âà 5,000 per variant
```

### Decision Rules for tinyArms

**Promote variant to production IF**:
```yaml
promote_conditions:
  # Condition 1: Statistical significance
  - p_value < 0.05  # 95% confidence (standard)

  # Condition 2: Practical significance
  - effect_size > 0.05  # 5% improvement minimum (TUNE based on user tolerance)

  # Condition 3: Sufficient sample
  - votes >= min_sample_size  # From power analysis (or 20-30 for small tests)

  # Condition 4: Bayesian confidence (if using Thompson Sampling)
  - bayesian_confidence > 0.95  # P(variant > baseline | data) > 95%
```

**Example Logic**:
```python
def should_promote(variant, baseline):
    # 1. Check p-value
    p_val = two_proportion_z_test(variant, baseline)
    if p_val >= 0.05:
        return False, "Not statistically significant"

    # 2. Check effect size
    effect = abs(variant.win_rate - baseline.win_rate)
    if effect < 0.05:
        return False, "Improvement too small (<5%)"

    # 3. Check sample size
    if variant.total_votes < 20:
        return False, "Insufficient votes"

    # 4. Bayesian confidence (optional)
    if using_thompson_sampling:
        prob_winner = bayesian_probability(variant, baseline)
        if prob_winner < 0.95:
            return False, "Bayesian confidence too low"

    return True, "Promote to production"
```

## Handling Small Samples (10-50 votes)

### Challenge: Traditional Methods Assume Large N

**Problem**: Formulas like `Z = (p1 - p2) / SE` rely on Central Limit Theorem ‚Üí need n ‚â• 30 for normal approximation. With 10-20 votes, confidence intervals become VERY WIDE, p-values lose reliability.

**Example**:
```
Variant A: 7/10 votes (70%)
Variant B: 4/10 votes (40%)

Frequentist 95% CI:
- A: [0.38, 0.91] - WIDE (53% range)
- B: [0.12, 0.74] - WIDE (62% range)
- Overlap ‚Üí "not significant" despite 30% difference

Bayesian 95% Credible Interval:
- A: Beta(8, 4) ‚Üí [0.47, 0.89] - similar width
- B: Beta(5, 7) ‚Üí [0.18, 0.62]
- Can estimate P(A > B) via Monte Carlo ‚Üí 89% (close to 95% threshold)
```

---

### Technique 1: Bayesian A/B Testing

**Advantages for Small Samples**:
1. **Incorporates prior knowledge**: If you know baseline accuracy is ~78%, use `Beta(78, 22)` as prior
2. **Credible intervals have intuitive interpretation**: "95% probability true value is in [a, b]" (vs frequentist: "if we repeat this 100 times, 95 intervals contain true value")
3. **Handles uncertainty naturally**: Wide posteriors = high uncertainty (don't make decisions)
4. **Sequential analysis built-in**: Update posterior after each vote (no "peeking penalty")

**Formula** (Beta-Binomial updating):
```
Prior: Beta(Œ±, Œ≤)
Observe: k successes in n trials
Posterior: Beta(Œ± + k, Œ≤ + (n - k))

Mean (expected value): (Œ± + k) / (Œ± + Œ≤ + n)
Variance: (Œ± + k)(Œ≤ + n - k) / [(Œ± + Œ≤ + n)¬≤ (Œ± + Œ≤ + n + 1)]
```

**Example with Informative Prior**:
```
Prior: Beta(78, 22) - "I expect 78% win rate"
Variant A: 7 üëç, 3 üëé
Posterior: Beta(78+7, 22+3) = Beta(85, 25)
Posterior mean: 85/110 = 0.773 (77.3%)

Prior: Beta(78, 22)
Variant B: 4 üëç, 6 üëé
Posterior: Beta(78+4, 22+6) = Beta(82, 28)
Posterior mean: 82/110 = 0.745 (74.5%)

Monte Carlo: P(A > B | data) ‚âà 78% (not confident enough)
```

### Technique 2: Exact Tests (Fisher's Exact Test)

**When to Use**: Very small samples (n < 20), binary outcomes, no normal approximation assumptions.

**Formula**: Calculates exact probability of observed data under null hypothesis using hypergeometric distribution.

**Example**:
```
        üëç    üëé    Total
Variant A:  7     3     10
Variant B:  4     6     10
Total:      11    9     20

Fisher's p-value ‚âà 0.19 (two-tailed)
```

**Interpretation**: "19% chance of seeing this split if variants are equal ‚Üí NOT significant"

**Source**: Wikipedia "Fisher's exact test"

**Tools**:
- SciPy: `scipy.stats.fisher_exact()`
- R: `fisher.test()`

---

### Technique 3: Bootstrapping

**How It Works**:
1. Resample WITH REPLACEMENT from observed data
2. Calculate statistic of interest (mean, difference, etc.)
3. Repeat 10,000 times ‚Üí build empirical distribution
4. Compute confidence intervals from percentiles

**Example**:
```python
import numpy as np

# Observed data
variant_a = [1]*7 + [0]*3  # 7 successes, 3 failures
variant_b = [1]*4 + [0]*6

# Bootstrap
n_bootstrap = 10000
differences = []

for _ in range(n_bootstrap):
    sample_a = np.random.choice(variant_a, size=10, replace=True)
    sample_b = np.random.choice(variant_b, size=10, replace=True)
    diff = sample_a.mean() - sample_b.mean()
    differences.append(diff)

# 95% CI for difference
ci = np.percentile(differences, [2.5, 97.5])
# Returns: [-0.1, 0.7] - wide range, includes 0 ‚Üí not significant
```

**Advantages**:
- No distributional assumptions (works for any metric)
- Intuitive (directly simulates sampling variability)
- Handles small samples (but CIs will be wide)

### Technique 4: Increase Œ± (Accept More Risk)

**Traditional**: Œ± = 0.05 (5% false positive rate)

**For small samples**: Œ± = 0.10 (10% false positive rate) trades less certainty for faster decisions.

**Why It Helps**:
- Lower threshold for "significance" (p < 0.10 instead of p < 0.05)
- Requires fewer samples to reach conclusion
- Appropriate when cost of Type I error (false positive) is LOW

**When Appropriate for tinyArms**:
- Prompt changes are REVERSIBLE (can rollback if wrong)
- Cost of bad prompt = user annoyance (not money, safety, legal issues)
- Benefit of faster iteration > risk of occasional false positive

**Recommendation**: Start with Œ± = 0.05 (standard), increase to Œ± = 0.10 IF waiting for samples becomes frustrating.

### Practical Configuration for Small Samples

**Recommended Approach**: Bayesian + Early Stopping

```yaml
# Small sample settings
small_sample_mode:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 50  # Use small sample methods if total_votes < 50

  # Bayesian approach
  prior_type: "informative"  # Use historical data
  prior_parameters:
    alpha: 78  # Baseline: 78% accuracy
    beta: 22   # Baseline: 22% errors

  # Decision criteria (more lenient for small samples)
  bayesian_confidence: 0.90  # 90% instead of 95%
  min_votes: 15              # 15 instead of 30
  alpha: 0.10                # 10% instead of 5%

  # Early stopping
  check_interval: 3          # Check every 3 votes (not 5)
  stop_if_obvious: true      # Stop at 15 votes if 90% confidence

# Example decision logic:
# - At 15 votes: If P(A > B) > 0.90 ‚Üí STOP, promote A
# - At 30 votes: If P(A > B) > 0.90 ‚Üí STOP, promote A
# - At 50 votes: If P(A > B) > 0.90 ‚Üí STOP, promote A
#               If P(A > B) < 0.90 ‚Üí STOP, no significant difference
```

P(variant_a > baseline | data) = 0.968
‚úÖ STOP: Variant A is significantly better (95% confidence)
```

**Observations**:
- **Early exploration**: All variants get tried initially (samples spread out)
- **Dynamic allocation**: Variant A (best performer) gets shown more often as confidence grows
- **Early stopping**: Detected winner at 20 votes (instead of waiting for 50)

## Appendix: Glossary

**Alpha (Œ±)**: Significance level, probability of Type I error (false positive). Standard: 0.05 (5%).

**Beta (Œ≤)**: Probability of Type II error (false negative). Standard: 0.20 (20% miss rate).

**Bayesian Credible Interval**: "95% probability true value is in [a, b]" (intuitive interpretation).

**Cohen's d**: Standardized effect size. Small=0.2, Medium=0.5, Large=0.8.

**Conjugate Prior**: Prior distribution that yields posterior in same family (e.g., Beta prior + Binomial likelihood = Beta posterior).

**Effect Size**: Magnitude of difference between variants (how big the improvement is).

**False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: Proportion of rejected null hypotheses that are false positives.

**Frequentist Confidence Interval**: "If we repeat this 100 times, 95 intervals contain true value" (procedural interpretation).

**Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest improvement your test can reliably detect given sample size and power.

**Multi-Armed Bandit**: Strategy that balances exploration (trying new variants) vs exploitation (using best variant).

**P-value**: Probability of observing data this extreme if null hypothesis (no difference) is true.

**Power (1-Œ≤)**: Probability of detecting real effect. Standard: 0.80 (80%).

**Sequential Testing**: Method allowing continuous monitoring and early stopping without inflating false positive rate.

**Statistical Significance**: Result unlikely to occur by chance alone (typically p < 0.05).

**Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian bandit algorithm that samples from posterior distributions to select actions.

**Type I Error**: False positive (declaring winner when none exists).

**Type II Error**: False negative (missing real winner).

**UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)**: Bandit algorithm that balances mean reward + uncertainty bonus.
