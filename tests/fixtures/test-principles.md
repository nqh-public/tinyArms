# Core Principles

## Principle I: Universal Reusability
Everything created must answer "Can someone else use this?"

## Principle II: Evidence-Based Completion
All code changes require line references (file.ts:42).

## Principle III: Architecture-First Development
Search npm/GitHub for proven solutions before writing custom code.

## Principle IV: Zero Invention Policy
When needed pattern doesn't exist → STOP → Request approval.

## Principle XVII: Pragmatic Atomic Composability (DRY)
Extract to shared location after 3+ duplicates of same logic/pattern.
